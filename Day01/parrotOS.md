#Commands used :
  - Basic : pwd , ls (file_name), cd , whoami , cat
  - cp(copy) : cp original_file_loc dest_file_loc *Must be run using sudo
  - rm(remove) sudo rm file_name

---

#What i did today :
  - Everything in Linux is stored as files, even the commands. So, 'ls' is also a file.
  - Copied 'ls' file to another file 'nwc' and now you can used nwc to list files instead of 'ls' !
  - Deleted 'ls' file. Cool!
  - Created a new user using 'adduser' from sbin , creates a password too.
  - * had to move to new user from /home but perm denied so ran 'sudo -i' to switch to root user.
    * then cd into home/newUser

Files at root '/' :
  1.bin - binary files
  2.sbin - super binary
  3.usr - files of this user
  4.local - store binaries that you create
  5.dev - devices(vda or sda)
  6.etc - networking file
  7.mnt and media - mount drives (media is for automatically mounted drives and mnt is for manually mounted drives)

  *both the root and user(usr) have the bin and sbin files. gen , usr has more commands than root. to find out which one it is using 'which cmd'. but why?
